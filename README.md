# StochasticBaskets
predicting and seeding the NCAA Tournament with stochastic models

## About
StochasticBaskets is a project that predicts and seeds the NCAA Tournament with stochastic models. StochasticBaskets builds on [BasketWise](https://github.com/nathanbronson/BasketWise), a previous experiment in predicting the NCAA Tournament outcomes using machine learning. StochasticBaskets was built by Nathan Bronson, Edward Donson, Tyler Headley, and Matthew Shield.

## Usage
The various experiments the project investigates are implemented in `main.py`. These projects rely on matchup probability models created by executing `prob.py`. Visualizations and analysis from the report along with the code to generate them can be found in the following notebooks: `graphs.ipynb`, `naive_approaches.ipynb`, and `prob_model_desc.ipynb`.
